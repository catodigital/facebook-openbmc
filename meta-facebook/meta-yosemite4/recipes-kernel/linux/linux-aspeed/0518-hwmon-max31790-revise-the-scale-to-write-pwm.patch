Subject: [PATCH 518/518] hwmon: max31790: revise the scale to write pwm

Since the value for PWMOUT Target Duty Cycle register is a 9 bit
left-justified value that ranges from 0 to 511 and is contained in 2
bytes.

There is an issue that the PWM signal recorded by oscilloscope would
not be on consistently if we set PWM to 100% to the driver.

It is because the LSB of the 9 bit would always be zero if it just
left shift 8 bit for the value that write to PWMOUT Target Duty
Cycle register.

Therefore, revise the scale of the value that was written to pwm input
from 255 to 511 and modify the value to left-justified value.
