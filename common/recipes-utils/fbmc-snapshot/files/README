1. Objective:
-------------
The ultimate goal is to make a new package "fbmc-snapshot" in the common
layer which can execute the common "showtech.sh" script along with the
fboss-lite layer specific and platform specific showtech plugins.


2. Description:
---------------
The "showtech.sh" is a script which will list the device info like hostname,
uptime, BMC version, Aspeed chip version, BMC board revision, etc,.
This package "fbmc-snapshot" is to make the existing showtech.sh script common
for all platforms. The layer(fboss-lite) specific scripts and platform specific
scripts can be added and installed in the device path /etc/showtech/rules/
using bbappend file of this fbmc-snapshot package. And the common showtech.sh
will execute all the scripts which are placed in /etc/showtech/rules/ as a part
of show_tech.

The plugins can be added with the naming conventions as follows,
File name starts with
1. 000-099 --> Common scripts.
2. 100-200 --> Fboss-lite
3. 900-999 --> Platform specific.

So that we can use this show tech script to get all the info regarding the
platform.


3. How to include this package in platforms:
--------------------------------------------
As of now, this package is included in Fuji and Montblanc platform. To include
this package in a platform, we need to add the pakage "fbmc-snapshot" in the
"IMAGE_INSTALL" section of image.bb file as shown as below,
Path : meta-facebook/meta-<platform>/recipes-core/images/<platform>-image.bb


4. How to add more plugins to the showtech:
-------------------------------------------
We can extend this showtech by adding more platform specific and fboss-lite
specific plugins with the proper naming conventions as mentioned in Description

	4.1.How to add plugins in the fboss-lite layer:
	-----------------------------------------------
	1.Need to add the script in the following path,
	  Path : meta-facebook/meta-fboss-lite/recipes-utils/fbmc-snapshot/files/
	  (file name should start with the range from 100 to 200 - ex:100_weutil.sh)

	2.Need to include the file name in the "LOCAL_URI" and "do_install:append()"
	  sections in the bbappend file,
	  Path: meta-facebook/meta-fboss-lite/recipes-utils/fbmc-snapshot/fbmc-snapshot_0.1.bbappend

	4.2.How to add platform specific plugins:
	-----------------------------------------
	1.Need to add the script in the following path,
      Path : meta-facebook/meta-<platform>/recipes-utils/fbmc-snapshot/files/
      (file name should start with the range from 900 to 999 - ex:900_dump_gpio.sh)

    2.Need to include the file name in the "LOCAL_URI" and "do_install:append()"
      sections in the bbappend file,
      Path: meta-facebook/meta-<platform>/recipes-utils/fbmc-snapshot/fbmc-snapshot_0.1.bbappend

Once the above steps are done, the plugins should be installed in the device
in this path "/etc/showtech/rules/" and the common showtech.sh will execute
all the plugins in this path as a part of showtech.
